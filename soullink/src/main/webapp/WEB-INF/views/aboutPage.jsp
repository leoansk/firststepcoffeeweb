	<h1>ABOUT FIRST STEP</h1>
	<p>
		Ever since the launch of First Step Coffee in Korea 2012, our
		excitement to serve our customers with specialty coffee has been on a
		rise. Each time a hand reaches over the counter to present a coffee to
		another outstretched hand, it’s a promise of our commitment to serve
		coffee of the highest quality. The impeccable quality of green beans
		in our roasts and brews has been sweetly cherished by our customers
		from Korea to Malaysia. We use only the finest coffee beans from
		exotic coffee producers around the globe. All our beans are
		hand-picked and use the process of "selective picking" to remove all
		impurities before being dried. Our philosophy of uncompromisingly
		high-quality roast is our dedication delivering hand-crafted coffee
		each and every day. First Step Coffee offers outstanding service from
		the best in class baristas which are happy and willing to impart all
		the secrets of coffee. Besides offering espresso base coffee, we are
		also equipped with a brew bar using single origins such as Siphons,
		V60’s, and Aeropress, to allow you to experience each brew's amazing
		flavours and characteristics.
